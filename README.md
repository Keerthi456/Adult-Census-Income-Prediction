# Adult-Census-Income-Prediction
In this project report we have a summary of our analysis and exploration of the Adult Census Data to come up with meaningful, important and interesting attributes of the data. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes we have performed a predictive task of classification, whether income is greater than or less than 50K/yr.
